MissingOutputException in rule getImages in file /home/cstansbu/git_repositories/pip-fucci/Snakefile, line 41:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/scratch/indikar_root/indikar1/cstansbu/pf-test/images/test_1.tiff
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
